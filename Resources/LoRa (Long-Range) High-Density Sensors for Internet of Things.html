The main purpose of this concept closely connected to the smart city issue is increasing the quality of life by contributing to streamlining resource consumption and protecting the environment. The LoRa communication mechanism is a physical layer of the LoRaWAN protocol, defined by the LoRa Alliance. Compared to other existing technologies, LoRa is a modulation technique enabling the transfer of information over a range of tens of kilometers. The main contribution this paper brings to the field is analyzing the scalability of the LoRa technology and determining the maximum number of sensors which can be integrated into this type of monitoring and control architecture. The sensor architecture is specific to the smart city concept that involves the integration of a large number of high-density sensors distributed on a large-scale geographic area. The reason behind this study is the need to assess the scalability of the LoRa technology, taking into consideration other factors, such as the packet payload size, the duty circle parameter, the spreading factor, and the number of nodes. The experimental results reveal that the maximum number of LoRa sensors that can communicate on the same channel is 1,500; furthermore, in order to obtain a high performance level, it is necessary to schedule and plan the network as carefully as possible. The spreading factor must be allocated according to the distance at which the sensor is placed from the gateway."><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://images.hindawi.com/journals/js/js.banner.jpg"><meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg"><meta property="og:image:width" content="600"><meta property="og:image:height" content="315"><meta property="og:title" content="LoRa (Long-Range) High-Density Sensors for Internet of Things"><meta name="twitter:site" content="website"><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"><meta name="twitter:image" content="https://images.hindawi.com/journals/js/js.banner.jpg"><meta name="twitter:title" content="LoRa (Long-Range) High-Density Sensors for Internet of Things"><meta property="og:description" content="Over the past few years, there has been a growing awareness regarding the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), which involves connecting to the Internet various objects surrounding us in everyday life.

of Internet of Things (IoT), which involves connecting to the Internet various objects surrounding us in everyday life. The main purpose of this concept closely connected to the smart city issue is increasing the quality of life by contributing to streamlining resource consumption and protecting the environment. The LoRa communication mechanism is a physical layer of the LoRaWAN protocol, defined by the LoRa Alliance. Compared to other existing technologies, LoRa is a modulation technique enabling the transfer of information over a range of tens of kilometers. The main contribution this paper brings to the field is analyzing the scalability of the LoRa technology and determining the maximum number of sensors which can be integrated into this type of monitoring and control architecture. The sensor architecture is specific to the smart city concept that involves the integration of a large number of high-density sensors distributed on a large-scale geographic area. The reason behind this study is the need to assess the scalability of the LoRa technology, taking into consideration other factors, such as the packet payload size, the duty circle parameter, the spreading factor, and the number of nodes. The experimental results reveal that the maximum number of LoRa sensors that can communicate on the same channel is 1,500; furthermore, in order to obtain a high performance level, it is necessary to schedule and plan the network as carefully as possible. The spreading factor must be allocated according to the distance at which the sensor is placed from the gateway.</p><span class="end-abs"></span><h4 id="introduction">1.

Today, it is impossible to develop a smart city without integrating this concept.</p><p>The main purpose of the concept is increasing the quality of life by contributing to streamlining of resources and protecting the environment. Considerable efforts have been made to increase the level of performance associated with a large-scale sensor network distributed on a very large geographic area. The battery should last for decades. The potential of these sensors is huge, as well as the number of applications which can be developed in various fields, such as environmental protection, smart cities, smart homes, disaster prevention, waste management, location tracking, smart metering, industrial, agriculture, transport, and logistics [<a class="refAnchor">2<div class="tooltip" style="display: none;">

          </div></a>].</p><p>Currently, there are a lot of standards, protocols, and communication mechanisms that promise to more or less solve the main problems of IoT. The main characteristic of this concept is that it provides communication capabilities to a wide number of sensors distributed over a large-scale geographic area. The challenges are great, taking into consideration the fact that the communication distance is limited by the resources available to these sensors (e.g., processing power, information storage, and energy resources). Also, to ensure the highest performance level possible, as well as the integration of a large number of sensors, intensive research focusing on streamlining and improving the communication mechanism is required.</p><p>The LPWA (Low-Power Wide Area) architectures have the highest potential.

Large-Scale LoRa Sensors for Long-Range Transmissions</h4><p>The LoRa modulation uses a modified frequency modulation (frequency-shift keying) that allows data to be transferred over a range of tens of kilometers. Figure <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig2/" target="_blank">2</a> shows the LoRaWAN (long-range wide area network) protocol defined by the LoRa Alliance. The Semtech-patented LoRa modulation is used at the physical level; this modulation operates in the ISM frequency band defined by the geographic area in which the sensors operate. The advantage of LoRa sensors is that they operate in the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) license-free bandwidth, so there are no additional license fees. The application level is defined by the user above the MAC level, already defined by the LoRa Alliance. The technology is not connected to a mobile network operator, so there is the possibility for it to be implemented by users in an open-source manner.</p><div class="floats-partial-section partial-carousel-wrapper" data-section="fig2"><div class="floats-partial-content fig-content-fig2 owl-loaded owl-drag"><div class="owl-stage-outer"><div class="owl-stage" style="transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transition: all 0s ease 0s; width: 559px;"><div class="owl-item active" style="width: 523.2px; margin-right: 35px;"><div class="partial-carousel--single-image"><img alt="" name="3502987.fig.002" src="./LoRa (Long-Range) High-Density Sensors for Internet of Things_files/3502987.fig.002.svgz"><br><strong></strong></div></div></div></div><div class="owl-nav disabled"><button type="button" role="presentation" class="owl-prev disabled">&lt;- Prev</button><button type="button" role="presentation" class="owl-next disabled">Next -&gt;</button></div><div class="owl-dots disabled"><button role="button" class="owl-dot active"><span></span></button></div></div><div class="floats-partial-footer"><div class="floats-partial-caption"><span class="expand_btn"></span><span class="minimize_btn"></span><span class="caption-text">Figure 2</span><a aria-label="full view" class="caption-partial-url" href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig2/" title="full view" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></div><div class="floats-partial-caption-text">LoRaWAN communication protocol stack.</div></div></div><p>In the IoT world, the LoRa communication protocol is seen as the holy grail because it comes to solve many challenges, like ensuring high-density connectivity for large-scale architecture sensors like those integrated in a smart city.</p><p>LoRaWAN is a low-power protocol that enables the connection of a sensor to the Internet, ensuring the lowest energy consumption possible [<a class="refAnchor">10<div class="tooltip" style="display: none;">

The main advantage of such an architecture is that it can integrate a large number of sensors, because the gateway modules can communicate with multiple sensors at the same time. The network uses a star topology so the architecture is similar to cellular networks. For a device to become a certified LoRaWAN gateway module, it must be able to receive and monitor all 8 channels simultaneously.</p><p>This feature allows for a major simplification of the communication mechanism and of the MAC level, because the integration of a routing protocol is no longer required. Thus, each sensor can communicate directly with the gateway module.</p><p>This simplicity of connectivity, supported by very long-distance communication, gives the LoRaWAN protocol the possibility to integrate a large number of sensors, with the benefits of a cellular-like topology.</p><p>Depending on the type of the application, the LoRa Alliance defines three classes of sensors (as presented in Figure <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig2/" target="_blank">2</a>):

When a sensor wants to send a message, it does not perform any previous checking of the communication channel for avoiding possible collisions. The long communication distance is obtained at the expense of the transfer rate. The LoRa technology is defined by three main parameters: spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), and carrier frequency.

          </div></a>] dealing with LoRa, but none investigates the issue of scalability.</p><p>The European 868 MHz ISM frequency band defines a number of 8 channels, each separated by a bandwidth of 0.3 MHz. Thus, if a sensor wants to send a message, it chooses a spreading factor, the communication channel, and the amount of energy used, and afterwards, it sends the message. After the transmission, the sensor opens two reception slots: the first one second after the completion of the transmission process and the second one second after the previous reception slot. In the event that the gateway module does not have any message to be transmitted, it ignores these slots. If the sensor does not receive any message in the first reception window, it does not open the next slot, thus reducing the power consumption.</p><p>The gateway sensors can simultaneously receive and transmit messages on all 8 communication channels, and each of the messages can be sent with a different spreading factor. It is possible to use acknowledgment packets so that the sensors have confirmation that the packet has been received correctly. The implementation of such a mechanism will definitely contribute to the increase of the energy consumption. The sensors receive MAC commands from the network server that coordinates the entire architecture by adapting and modifying parameters, such as the spreading factor and the communication channel through an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism. The main purpose is to increase the level of performance [<a class="refAnchor">28<div class="tooltip" style="display: none;">

The chirp sequence is much faster than the original data signal, and thus, the bandwidth of the given signal is extended; therefore, spectral spreading is performed, and the interference resistance is increased.</p><p>Because of the simplicity of this communication mechanism, the hardware structure of sensors is simple; so, a major advantage is that the sensors are very inexpensive. Also, decreasing the number of messages that a sensor can send, increases the energy efficiency.</p><p>An important aspect of modulation is that it turns each bit sequence into a symbol, doubling the number of the output samples needed to modulate a symbol. Because of this aspect, the LoRa technology becomes a very slow modulation.</p><p>This feature limits the applicability of the mechanism regarding real-time monitoring systems, where latency is important.

The packet error rate (PER) parameter is analyzed in order to assess the performance level. The parameter is analyzed globally at a scenario level, and it is expressed as a percentage, representing the ratio between the number of erroneous received packets and the total number of sent packets.</p><p>This parameter is strictly influenced by the number of collisions that may occur on the communication channel. Most of the time, these collisions occur because of the big number of sensors. In the case of the LoRa communication, two messages sent on the same channel with different spreading factors will not interfere with each other, but there may be collisions due to the capture effect phenomenon.</p><p>In experimental scenarios, each LoRa sensor sends packets using different configurations (e.g., spreading factors).

To achieve an acceptable performance level, it is recommended that the PER parameter does not exceed 10%, thus avoiding the resending of packages.</p><p>From the obtained results, we can see that for a 10% PER, when a 70-byte payload is used, the network integrates a number of 200 sensors. We can integrate 50 sensors for a 50-byte payload and almost 1,000 sensors for a 30-byte payload.</p><p>If a 10-byte payload is used, the maximum number of sensors that can be integrated into a LoRa architecture is approximately 1,500. Taking into account that a gateway module can communicate and monitor 8 channels simultaneously, the number of sensors that can communicate on a channel can grow even more.</p><p>Figure <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig5/" target="_blank">5</a> shows the PER parameter when a number of 2,000 sensors are integrated and the spreading factor used is 12.

Whereas in the first case we had a PER of 15% for 2,000 sensors if a 10-byte payload was used, in this case, we get a PER of about 98%.</p><p>Thus, the experimental scenario where the lowest transfer rate is approximately 0.36 kbps provides the highest PER. These aspects should not be neglected when implementing a LoRa sensor architecture.</p><p>Most of the time, the default settings of these sensors involve the use of a spreading factor of 12, obviously for reasons related to the communication range; this results in the crowding of the communication channel, the increase of the number of collisions, and, consequently, in the drastic decrease of the performance level.</p><p>Figure <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig6/" target="_blank">6</a> shows the PER parameter when 5,000 sensors are integrated and the spreading factor used is 7.

For these reasons, a better understanding of the LoRa communication mechanism is needed in order to increase the performance level as much as possible. Choosing most often the configuration that ensures the highest radius of communication determines the significant decrease in the number of nodes. This decision must be based on the specifics of the application.</p><p>In the second set of modeled scenarios, all sensors communicate using the same spreading factor; the duty cycle parameter is being modified this time by altering the total number of packets sent by each sensor within the network. The main purpose is to assess how the duty cycle influences the performance level.</p><p>Figure <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig8/" target="_blank">8</a> shows the PER parameter in which the duty cycle is varied from 0.1% to 0.5% and the spreading factor used is 7. The maximum regulated duty cycle is 1%, taking into account the limitations imposed by the ISM operation band and the communication power. Thus, the access of a sensor to the communication channel is limited. From the obtained results, it can be noticed that for a duty cycle of 0.5%, the PER parameter reaches the maximum value of 100%, corresponding to the case when no package is received; in comparison, when the duty cycle is 0.1%, the maximum PER is approximately 75%.</p><div class="floats-partial-section partial-carousel-wrapper" data-section="fig8"><div class="floats-partial-content fig-content-fig8 owl-loaded owl-drag"><div class="owl-stage-outer"><div class="owl-stage" style="transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); transition: all 0s ease 0s; width: 559px;"><div class="owl-item active" style="width: 523.2px; margin-right: 35px;"><div class="partial-carousel--single-image"><img alt="" name="3502987.fig.008" src="./LoRa (Long-Range) High-Density Sensors for Internet of Things_files/3502987.fig.008.svgz"><br><strong></strong></div></div></div></div><div class="owl-nav disabled"><button type="button" role="presentation" class="owl-prev disabled">&lt;- Prev</button><button type="button" role="presentation" class="owl-next disabled">Next -&gt;</button></div><div class="owl-dots disabled"><button role="button" class="owl-dot active"><span></span></button></div></div><div class="floats-partial-footer"><div class="floats-partial-caption"><span class="expand_btn"></span><span class="minimize_btn"></span><span class="caption-text">Figure 8</span><a aria-label="full view" class="caption-partial-url" href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2019/3502987/fig8/" title="full view" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a></div><div class="floats-partial-caption-text">The packet error rate parameter for SF 7 and different duty cycles.</div></div></div><p>The results highlight the importance of choosing properly the spreading factor and the duty cycle when the initial implementation of sensor network is performed.

In order to ensure connectivity when the distance from the gateway is increased, the spreading factor is also increased by the network server. This aspect generates a high number of collisions because the packets spent more time on air. The optimization of the radio communication parameters is done by using MAC commands. These commands allow the network server to fully control the entire LoRa network composed of thousands of nodes.</p><div class="floats-partial-section partial-other-wrapper" data-section="tab3"><div

If the packet payload is increased, the time on air also increases, thus becoming more susceptible to collisions.

          </div></a>]. One possible solution would be to implement and integrate a channel access mechanism; this mechanism can reduce the collisions that decrease the performance of the architecture.</p><p>For these reasons, a better understanding of the LoRa communication mechanism is needed so that the performance level is as high as possible. Choosing most of the time the configuration that ensures the highest radius of communication determines a significant decrease in the number of nodes. This decision has to be made according to the specificity of the application, taking into account several factors.</p><p>The obtained results highlight the importance of properly choosing the spreading factor and the duty cycle, when the sensor network is initially implemented. Another parameter of crucial importance that should not be neglected is the payload. The experimental results show that once with the increase of the spreading factor, the PER parameter also increases, even if the transfer rate decreases considerably. This behavior is generated by the particularity of the LoRa communication mechanism.</p><p>The experimental results obtained show that the maximum number of LoRa sensors that can communicate on the same channel is 1,500 in the configuration with a SF of 7 and a payload of 10 bytes. Thus, in order to achieve a high level of performance, it is necessary to plan the network as carefully as possible, and the spreading factor has to be allocated depending on the distance of the gateway mode sensor. Also, the package size should be as small as possible so that the collision packet exposure is as small as possible.</p><p>The number of sensors assigned to operate on a certain spreading factor must be carefully monitored to avoid retransmissions and lower performance levels. Thus, at the level of the network server, the implementation of a mechanism that avoids the allocation of the same factor to a very large number of sensors is necessary; the mechanism can also monitor the distance at which these sensors are placed. Only with an accurate control of these parameters is it possible to integrate as many sensors as possible.</p><h4 id="data-availability">Data Availability</h4><p>The data results used to support the findings of this study are presented in this paper.</p><h4 id="conflicts-of-interest">Conflicts of Interest</h4><p>The author declares that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</p><h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4><p>This work was partially supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.2-PCCDI-2017-0776/No. 36 PCCDI/15.03.2018, within PNCDI III, and partially by the project “Integrated Center for Research, Development and Innovation in Advanced Materials, Nanotechnologies, and Distributed Systems for Fabrication and Control (MANSiD),” Contract No. 671/09.04.2015, and the Sectoral Operational Program for Increase of the Economic Competitiveness cofunded from the European Regional Development Fund.</p></div><div class="xml-content"><h4 class="references" id="references">References</h4><ol><li id="B1">B.

data-description="Over the past few years, there has been a growing awareness regarding the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), which involves connecting to the Internet various objects surrounding us in everyday life. The main purpose of this concept closely connected to the smart city issue is increasing the quality of life by contributing to streamlining resource consumption and protecting the environment. The LoRa communication mechanism is a physical layer of the LoRaWAN protocol, defined by the LoRa Alliance. Compared to other existing technologies, LoRa is a modulation technique enabling the transfer of information over a range of tens of kilometers. The main contribution this paper brings to the field is analyzing the scalability of the LoRa technology and determining the maximum number of sensors which can be integrated into this type of monitoring and control architecture. The sensor architecture is specific to the smart city concept that involves the integration of a large number of high-density sensors distributed on a large-scale geographic area. The reason behind this study is the need to assess the scalability of the LoRa technology, taking into consideration other factors, such as the packet payload size, the duty circle parameter, the spreading factor, and the number of nodes. The experimental results reveal that the maximum number of LoRa sensors that can communicate on the same channel is 1,500; furthermore, in order to obtain a high performance level, it is necessary to schedule and plan the network as carefully as possible. The spreading factor must be allocated according to the distance at which the sensor is placed from the gateway." style="clear: both;"><div id="atstbx" class="at-resp-share-element at-style-responsive

Introduction\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the past few years, there has been a growing awareness regarding the concept of Internet of Things (IoT), which involves connecting to the Internet various objects surrounding us in everyday life [\u003ca href=\"#B1\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e]. Today, it is impossible to develop a smart city without integrating this concept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main purpose of the concept is increasing the quality of life by contributing to streamlining of resources and protecting the environment. Considerable efforts have been made to increase the level of performance associated with a large-scale sensor network distributed on a very large geographic area. The battery should last for decades. The potential of these sensors is huge, as well as the number of applications which can be developed in various fields, such as environmental protection, smart cities, smart homes, disaster prevention, waste management, location tracking, smart metering, industrial, agriculture, transport, and logistics [\u003ca href=\"#B2\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrently, there are a lot of standards, protocols, and communication mechanisms that promise to more or less solve the main problems of IoT. The main characteristic of this concept is that it provides communication capabilities to a wide number of sensors distributed over a large-scale geographic area. The challenges are great, taking into consideration the fact that the communication distance is limited by the resources available to these sensors (e.g., processing power, information storage, and energy resources).

The advantage of LoRa sensors is that they operate in the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) license-free bandwidth, so there are no additional license fees. The application level is defined by the user above the MAC level, already defined by the LoRa Alliance.

When a LoRa node transmits a packet, it is received by the gateway module which, in turn, sends it back to the network server. The latter centralizes and controls the entire LoRaWAN network, being responsible for sending MAC commands that are designed to increase the performance level of the architecture. The necessity of an accurate control of sensor’s parameters is very important and must not be neglected when designing a LoRa network [\u003ca href=\"#B18\"\u003e18\u003c/a\u003e].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-section partial-carousel-wrapper\" data-section=\"fig3\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-content fig-content-fig3\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"partial-carousel--single-image\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" name=\"3502987.fig.003\" src=\"https://static-01.hindawi.com/articles/js/volume-2019/3502987/figures/3502987.fig.003.svgz\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-footer\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption-text\"\u003eFigure 3\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca aria-label=\"full view\" class=\"caption-partial-url\" href=\"fig3/\" title=\"full view\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption-text\"\u003eLoRaWAN sensor network.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe user interface application is located at the application server, the level where the user can query the data by receiving and viewing different reports. The main advantage of such an architecture is that it can integrate a large number of sensors, because the gateway modules can communicate with multiple sensors at the same time. The network uses a star topology so the architecture is similar to cellular networks. For a device to become a certified LoRaWAN gateway module, it must be able to receive and monitor all 8 channels simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis feature allows for a major simplification of the communication mechanism and of the MAC level, because the integration of a routing protocol is no longer required. Thus, each sensor can communicate directly with the gateway module.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis simplicity of connectivity, supported by very long-distance communication, gives the LoRaWAN protocol the possibility to integrate a large number of sensors, with the benefits of a cellular-like topology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDepending on the type of the application, the LoRa Alliance defines three classes of sensors (as presented in Figure \u003ca href=\"fig2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e):\n\u003cspan class=\"list\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-item\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-label\"\u003e(i)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-content\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eClass A\u003c/i\u003e: the sensor periodically sends packets to the gateway module. After completing the sending process, the node keeps the receiver active for a very short period of time, in which it can receive data from the gateway. After completing this cycle, the sensor enters sleep mode in order to save energy. Also, the duty cycle parameter limits the maximum number of packets a sensor can transmit in one day\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-item\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-label\"\u003e(ii)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"list-content\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eClass B\u003c/i\u003e: unlike class A, this type of sensor has programmed receiving time slots.

When a sensor wants to send a message, it does not perform any previous checking of the communication channel for avoiding possible collisions. The long communication distance is obtained at the expense of the transfer rate. The LoRa technology is defined by three main parameters: spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), and carrier frequency. The transfer rate varies by using orthogonal spreading factors which is a compromise between distance and emission power [\u003ca href=\"#B19\"\u003e19\u003c/a\u003e]. Thus, a high level of performance is achieved within a communication system in which the frequency band is limited. There are a number of papers in the literature [\u003ca href=\"#B20\"\u003e20\u003c/a\u003e–\u003ca href=\"#B27\"\u003e27\u003c/a\u003e] dealing with LoRa, but none investigates the issue of scalability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe European 868 MHz ISM frequency band defines a number of 8 channels, each separated by a bandwidth of 0.3 MHz. Thus, if a sensor wants to send a message, it chooses a spreading factor, the communication channel, and the amount of energy used, and afterwards, it sends the message. After the transmission, the sensor opens two reception slots: the first one second after the completion of the transmission process and the second one second after the previous reception slot. In the event that the gateway module does not have any message to be transmitted, it ignores these slots. If the sensor does not receive any message in the first reception window, it does not open the next slot, thus reducing the power consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe gateway sensors can simultaneously receive and transmit messages on all 8 communication channels, and each of the messages can be sent with a different spreading factor. It is possible to use acknowledgment packets so that the sensors have confirmation that the packet has been received correctly. The implementation of such a mechanism will definitely contribute to the increase of the energy consumption. The sensors receive MAC commands from the network server that coordinates the entire architecture by adapting and modifying parameters, such as the spreading factor and the communication channel through an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism. The main purpose is to increase the level of performance [\u003ca href=\"#B28\"\u003e28\u003c/a\u003e].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy increasing the bandwidth of a modulated signal, it is possible to compensate the degradation generated by the noise on the communication channel. This is the basic principle of spectral spreading. In classical transmission systems involving DSSS (Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum), the signal emitted by the transmitter undergoes changes in accordance to a sequence of code [\u003ca href=\"#B29\"\u003e29\u003c/a\u003e].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis process is generally performed by multiplying the desired data signal with a propagation code known as the chirp radar sequence for LoRa modulation. The chirp sequence is much faster than the original data signal, and thus, the bandwidth of the given signal is extended; therefore, spectral spreading is performed, and the interference resistance is increased.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of the simplicity of this communication mechanism, the hardware structure of sensors is simple; so, a major advantage is that the sensors are very inexpensive. Also, decreasing the number of messages that a sensor can send, increases the energy efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn important aspect of modulation is that it turns each bit sequence into a symbol, doubling the number of the output samples needed to modulate a symbol. Because of this aspect, the LoRa technology becomes a very slow modulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis feature limits the applicability of the mechanism regarding real-time monitoring systems, where latency is important. However, this redundancy makes LoRa a very robust modulation, capable of being demodulated below the noise level, making it possible to reach very large communication distances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTable \u003ca href=\"tab1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e presents the main characteristics of the LoRa technology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-section partial-other-wrapper\" data-section=\"tab1\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-content fig-content-tab1\"\u003e\u003ctable class=\"table-group\" id=\"tab1\"\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ctable class=\"table\"\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"thead-hr\" colspan=\"2\"\u003e\u003chr /\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr class=\"thead\"\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eTechnology\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eLoRa\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"thead-hr\" colspan=\"2\"\u003e\u003chr /\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eTechnique\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eChirp spread spectrum\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eModulation\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eFrequency chirps\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\" rowspan=\"3\"\u003eChannel bandwidth (uplink)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e125 kHz\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e250 kHz\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e500 kHz\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eLow power\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eBattery lifetime of decades\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eLong range\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eTens of kilometers\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eData rate\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e0.3-50 kbps\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eSensitivity\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e-137 dBm\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eLink budget\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eAbove 140 dB\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eBand\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eISM: sub-GHz\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eCommunication type\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eBidirectional\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eTransmit power\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003e14 dBm\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eNetwork topology\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eStar\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_left\"\u003eProprietary\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd class=\"align_center\"\u003eSemtech\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr class=\"table-tr\"\u003e\u003ctd colspan=\"2\"\u003e\u003chr class=\"tbody-hr\" /\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-footer\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption-text\"\u003eTable 1\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca aria-label=\"full view\" class=\"caption-partial-url\" href=\"tab1/\" title=\"full view\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption-text\"\u003eLoRa modulation.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"lora-sensor-scalability-analyses-and-performance-evaluation\"\u003e3.

From the obtained results, it can be noticed that for a duty cycle of 0.5%, the PER parameter reaches the maximum value of 100%, corresponding to the case when no package is received; in comparison, when the duty cycle is 0.1%, the maximum PER is approximately 75%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-section partial-carousel-wrapper\" data-section=\"fig8\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-content fig-content-fig8\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"partial-carousel--single-image\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" name=\"3502987.fig.008\" src=\"https://static-01.hindawi.com/articles/js/volume-2019/3502987/figures/3502987.fig.008.svgz\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-footer\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"caption-text\"\u003eFigure 8\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca aria-label=\"full view\" class=\"caption-partial-url\" href=\"fig8/\" title=\"full view\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"floats-partial-caption-text\"\u003eThe packet error rate parameter for SF 7 and different duty cycles.\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe results highlight the importance of choosing properly the spreading factor and the duty cycle when the initial implementation of sensor network is performed.

Conclusions\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this paper, the level of performance of the LoRa technology is assessed by performing a scalability analysis. Thus, the main purpose was to determine the maximum number of sensors that can be integrated into such an architecture specific to the concept of IoT.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, a series of solutions and possible improvements that can efficiently contribute to increasing the performance level has been presented. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of the LoRa technology scalability. The influence of the packet payload was analyzed. From the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study that addresses this issue and proposes different solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe varied parameters from the analyzed scenarios were the following: the spreading factor, the size of the packet payload, the number of nodes, and the duty cycle parameter. If the packet payload is increased, the time on air also increases, thus becoming more susceptible to collisions. The obtained values characterize the LoRa mechanism, which is a specific ALOHA [\u003ca href=\"#B26\"\u003e26\u003c/a\u003e]. One possible solution would be to implement and integrate a channel access mechanism; this mechanism can reduce the collisions that decrease the performance of the architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor these reasons, a better understanding of the LoRa communication mechanism is needed so that the performance level is as high as possible. Choosing most of the time the configuration that ensures the highest radius of communication determines a significant decrease in the number of nodes. This decision has to be made according to the specificity of the application, taking into account several factors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe obtained results highlight the importance of properly choosing the spreading factor and the duty cycle, when the sensor network is initially implemented. Another parameter of crucial importance that should not be neglected is the payload. The experimental results show that once with the increase of the spreading factor, the PER parameter also increases, even if the transfer rate decreases considerably. This behavior is generated by the particularity of the LoRa communication mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe experimental results obtained show that the maximum number of LoRa sensors that can communicate on the same channel is 1,500 in the configuration with a SF of 7 and a payload of 10 bytes. Thus, in order to achieve a high level of performance, it is necessary to plan the network as carefully as possible, and the spreading factor has to be allocated depending on the distance of the gateway mode sensor. Also, the package size should be as small as possible so that the collision packet exposure is as small as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe number of sensors assigned to operate on a certain spreading factor must be carefully monitored to avoid retransmissions and lower performance levels. Thus, at the level of the network server, the implementation of a mechanism that avoids the allocation of the same factor to a very large number of sensors is necessary; the mechanism can also monitor the distance at which these sensors are placed. Only with an accurate control of these parameters is it possible to integrate as many sensors as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"data-availability\"\u003eData Availability\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data results used to support the findings of this study are presented in this paper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"conflicts-of-interest\"\u003eConflicts of Interest\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe author declares that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"acknowledgments\"\u003eAcknowledgments\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis work was partially supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.2-PCCDI-2017-0776/No. 36 PCCDI/15.03.2018, within PNCDI III, and partially by the project “Integrated Center for Research, Development and Innovation in Advanced Materials, Nanotechnologies, and Distributed Systems for Fabrication and Control (MANSiD),” Contract No. 671/09.04.2015, and the Sectoral Operational Program for Increase of the Economic Competitiveness cofunded from the European Regional Development Fund.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"xml-content\"\u003e\u003ch4 class=\"references\" id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h4\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli id=\"B1\"\u003eB.
