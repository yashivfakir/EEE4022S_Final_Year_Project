## **LoRa Based Communication System for Radiosonde Applications**


URL for Repository: https://github.com/yashivfakir/EEE4022S_Final_Year_Project.git

The files found in this repository are for the LoRa based communication device for weather balloon comunication. The object of the project was to explore the possibility of using LoRa technology for long range weather balloon communication. The LoRa modules that were utilized for the project are the:
  + LILYGO TTGO LoRa32 module @ 838 MHz
  + Dragino LoRa Shield @ 433 MHz


Several progress summaries were written up during the project that outline the findings:
  + [SP21-06S] LoRa Based Communication System for Radiosonde Applications.pdf  (Project Specification document)
  + LORA - Summary.pptx
  + LoRa Project Update.pptx
